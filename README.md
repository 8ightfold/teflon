## Update: 
Dead project. Code is pretty old and bad. Sorry Eczbek!

# Teflon Library

~~This is a compilation of all my projects, plus a little more. This library is not even close to being finished, but this is what is included at the moment.~~


- **Dawn:** Constexpr oriented functionality, aims to make your life a bit easier.
- **Function:** Adds utilities aimed at function manipulation, including: extended casting, private member extraction and rerouting.
- **Preprocessing:** Defines utility macros that can aide in things such as platform deduction and deferred concatenation.
- **Util:** Includes miscellaneous utilities such as timers.
- **xIO (extended input/output):** Extends the standard's `<iostream>`, adding utilities such as stream wrappers (future) and portable type identifiers.
- **xTraits (extended type traits):** Extends `<type_traits>`, adding helper structs for more specific needs.

Documentation is in progress, but more complex utils have a description of how they work in their respective files.

There are many things I want to add to this library in the future, with things like extended variadic macros, global thread-safe memory pools, and type-only tuples already in the works.
